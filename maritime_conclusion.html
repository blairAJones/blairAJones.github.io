      <h1 class="mb-4">Conclusions</h1>

      <p>This project studied over one hundred thousand footwear shipments over the past five years to answer the following:</p>

      <h3>Can landed costs be predicted?</h3>
      <p>Yes, for the available shipments with CIF terms, both tree-based and neural network regression models were able to
        predict costs with high $R^2$ values (over 85%) and predictive power over the standard deviation (\$5-\$6 compared
        with \$16 std. dev.). Both these model types allow for flexibility in numerous categorical data, which is important
        for this data set. Interpretability is higher for the tree-based models over the neural networks; but overall
        performance for costs was highest for the attention model. </p>

      <h3>Can delays be predicted?</h3>
      <p>Partially. Tree-based models were used given the high number of categorical features as well as larger data set
        (160K+ lines, compared with costs only using the CIF data at 14K+). The random forest model predicted delays within
        3.3 days; compared with an overall standard deviation of 5.7 days. </p>

      <h3>Are there impacts to recent 2025 tariff announcements and implementations?</h3>
      <p>Yes, based on the negative binomial (counts) and Mann-Whitney U tests (weight), a number of countries displayed
        significant changes in shipment rates pre and post tariff announcements (both increases noted in some southeast Asian
        countries like Indonesia and Vietnam along with the decrease from China). For Chinese suppliers, the rate and volume
        in which shipments originating from China vs. Non-Chinese countries changed significantly in the post period.
      </p>

      <h3>Which models / techniques perform best on this data?</h3>
      <p>As expected, tree-based models performed well given the flexibility and the high number of categorical features. In
        addition, the random selection of features and regularization allow for these models to adjust to potential
        correlation between features. Initially, these outperformed neural network models until new embedded features (which
        are randomly initialized then learned during training) like company name and supplier country were added. It is
        thought that using one-hot-encoding for the large number of unique categorical features did not help these models
        learn the data, and only when the dense embeddings were formed did the neural networks perform above standard machine
        learning techniques. </p>

      <h2>Considerations</h2>
      <p>As mentioned above, <em>Country of Origin</em> is the determination of tariff rates and not <em>departure port</em>.
        Lacking the ability to obtain a commercial invoice which should state the proper origin, this analysis had to work
        with the available data which only includes the port in which the goods last left before arriving in the United
        States. It cannot be said with certainty that changes in departure ports post-2025 tariffs announcements are suppliers
        actively avoiding tariffs. This analysis was prepared to identify if there were any changes in business behavior that
        could be statistically tested.
      
        Also, the post tariff period is only six months, so the observed patterns may be temporary. </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Future Analysis</h2>
      <p>Additional product searches for other goods would be a natural continuation of this research. In addition, a more
        in-depth analysis of vendor and customer relationships and concentrations could deepen the analysis and help explain
        larger business trends. Given the success of some categorical feature embeddings within the neural networks,
        additional feature engineering should be considered. Also, continuing to track movement from exporting countries would
        provide a longer-term picture of tariff impacts once more time has passed, as well as looking at other dates as
        cut-off points given the ever-changing announcements at the beginning and through 2025. </p>
