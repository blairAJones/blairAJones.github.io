Trends using ML</h2>
<p>In 2024, eBay.com had $8.6Bn marketplace <a
href="https://investors.ebayinc.com/financial-information/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=18232012">revenue</a>
and Amazon.com had $530Bn <a
href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/ar/Amazon-2024-Annual-Report.pdf">revenue</a>.
The US Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce estimates US online retail sales of 
over $300Bn for just the first quarter of 2025 alone <a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/ecommerce.html">link</a>.
For better or worse, online shopping is a significant source of revenue
for some of the largest corporations in the world and is a near daily
habit for millions of people.</p>
<p>eBay maintains an <a href="https://developer.ebay.com/">API
service</a> for developer accounts which can return data on current
listings for user-defined browsing categories. Unfortunately, the API
service which tracked actual sales was deprecated in 2024. However, it
is believed that current listings can tell a story on market prices for
select items, and various quantitative and qualitative features can be
used to model price prediction and the flagging of competitively priced
or overpriced items.</p>
<p>Amazon listings were obtained from a 3rd party service called <a
href="https://app.rainforestapi.com/playground">Rainforest API</a>. This
service allows the user to obtain current listings based on search term
or drill-down specifically on items based on asin (Amazon.com specific
ID).</p>
<p>To start, eBay was searched for two different types of products:
first, iPhone 16, which is a recent and popular consumer good that has
many listings and some differentiation (model type, storage, etc.).
Then, another eBay search was completed on soccer jerseys, which are
highly specific, with some seen as “collectible”. This specific search
was of interest because of the upcoming World Cup in 2026 (both club and
country jerseys appeared in this search).</p>
<p>On Amazon, there were two searches performed: Microwaves, a fairly
homogeneous product with potential large price impacts from recent
tariff actions, and Lego, a popular product that can have a “style”
factor. Depending on if data can be made available from another 3rd
party service which tracks historical Amazon prices, additional analysis
on price increases in the last year would be compelling.</p>
<p><img src="/images/summary_table.png" /></p>
<p>The project plans to work with the available retail data and answer
the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can item prices be accurately predicted based on current listings,
including information like days-on-hand, markdowns, seller/product
ratings, recent sales (Amazon)?</li>
<li>Which features are most significant in these predictions?</li>
<li>Do these models vary based on item type? For example, iPhone 16 vs
soccer jerseys, where there is some differention with phone model types
but lots of similar listings, compared with soccer jerseys which are
highly specific.<br />
</li>
<li>Do prices follow a normal distribution, or would a log
transformation be prudent? Or possibly modeling based on another
distribution, like using Poission for recent sales counts, for
example.<br />
</li>
<li>Can a machine learning model help determine which items or listings
are competitively priced or overpriced, compared to others?</li>
<li>On eBay, do longer titles and more pictures indicate a higher
quality listing?</li>
<li>Are there differences in feature significance with seller ratings on
eBay compared with product ratings on Amazon?</li>
<li>Will tree-based models peform better on this data given the number
of qualitative features?</li>
<li>How could a recommender system and / or sentiment analysis of
reviews be incorporated into future versions of the model?</li>
<li>(Likely for future analysis) Have the announcements for recent
tariffs caused preemptive or necessary increases in prices for home
goods (e.g. microwaves)? Answering this would require gaining access to
another API service which tracks historical Amazon prices.</li>
</ul>
