      <h1 class="mb-4" id="undertanding-shopping-trends-using-ml">Understanding Online Shopping
        Trends using ML</h1>
      <p>In 2024, eBay.com had $8.6Bn marketplace <a
          href="https://investors.ebayinc.com/financial-information/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=18232012" target="_blank">revenue</a>
        and Amazon.com had $530Bn <a
          href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/ar/Amazon-2024-Annual-Report.pdf" target="_blank">revenue</a>.
        The US Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce estimates US online retail sales of
        over $300Bn for just the first quarter of <a
          href="https://www.census.gov/retail/ecommerce.html" target="_blank">2025</a> alone.
        Per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, this represents 16.2% of total retail sales,
        a percentage that has been steadily climbing since 2000, with a larger jump 
        <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECOMPCTSA" target="_blank">in 2020</a>.
        Online retail sites are teeming with data, both supplier and customer generated.  
        The data on these sites can be harnessed to help both buyers and sellers understand
        market forces, without having to fully rely on the retailer's algorithm. Both eBay and Amazon utilize
        sophisticated models on their own data <a href="https://innovation.ebayinc.com/stories/ebays-platform-is-powered-by-ai-and-fueled-by-customer-input/" target="_blank">for example</a>; 
        however, one needs to consider the motivation of the corporation, compared with the buyers and sellers.    
        Online shopping is a significant source of revenue
        for some of the world's largest corporations and is a near daily
        habit for millions of people.  Resources that improve transparency in retail
        make for more efficient markets and a more empowered consumer.</p>
      <p>eBay maintains an <a href="https://developer.ebay.com/" target="_blank">API
          service</a> for developer accounts which can return data on current
        listings for user-defined browsing categories. Unfortunately, the API
        service which tracked final sales was deprecated in 2024. However, it
        is believed that current listings can tell a story on market prices for
        select items, and various quantitative and qualitative features can be
        used to model price prediction and the flagging of competitively priced
        or overpriced items.</p>
      <p>Amazon listings were obtained from a 3rd party service called <a
          href="https://app.rainforestapi.com/playground" target="_blank">Rainforest API</a>. This
        service allows the user to obtain current listings based on search term
        or drill-down specifically on items based on asin (Amazon.com specific
        ID).</p>
      <p>To start, the eBay API was utilized for searching two different types of products:
        first, iPhone 16, which is a recent and popular consumer good that has
        many listings and some differentiation (model type, storage, etc.).
        Then, another eBay search was completed on soccer jerseys, which are
        highly specific, with some seen as “collectible”. This specific search
        was of interest because of the upcoming World Cup in 2026 (both club and
        country jerseys appeared in this search).</p>
      <p>On Amazon, there were two searches performed: Microwaves, a fairly
        homogeneous product with potential large price impacts from recent
        tariff actions, and Lego, a popular product that can have a “style”
        factor. Depending on if data can be made available from another 3rd
        party service which tracks historical Amazon prices, additional analysis
        on price increases in the last year would be compelling.</p>
      <p>The data cleaning process continues throughout the project as important information is embedded within 
        product titles on these websites; especially for eBay in which the seller is able to "sell" their product 
        with additional details not found in a specific field.  For example, iPhone model numbers and carrier restrictions 
        were found in the iPhone titles and specific team and country information were found in the soccer jerseys data.  For 
        the Amazon data, microwave sizes and Lego styles / age recommendations are found in the microwaves and Lego data, respectively.
        For the eBay data, title length (by characters) and number of additional images posted were considered new calculated fields 
        as features to assess listing quality.
      </p>

        <figcaption aria-hidden="true" style="font-size: 13px;">Example listing with many additional pictures 
          and team / year in title</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> As more models are tested, additional findings are noted.  Pricing tier classification using Random Forest models
        worked well on almost all data sets, and noted different levels of feature importance.  This indicates that there are 
        inherent differences in product pricing strategies.  For example, from the RF models on the iPhones and Soccer data, 
        respectively,
        the top feature importance for pricing tiers was model number (product differentiation) for iPhones and seller feedback 
        score
        (seller differentiation) for Soccer jerseys.  For Microwaves and Lego products, cubic feet (product differentiation)
        and ratings totals (product popularity) were the top important features, respectively.  
      </p>
      <p> Working through additional classification models like support vector machines revealed the power of hyperparameter 
        tuning.  Many combinations of parameters were trained and validated with all data sets returning different results.  
        In addition, post-hoc analysis like calibration was completed to further refine models (in this case, 
        decision thresholds) based on probabilities.  Changing scoring metrics in grid search tuning showed that there is a 
        delicate balance to parameters in relation to model performance as one slight change can meaningfully change test results.  
        As this data is not the type that would suffer greatly from poor recall (as would medical testing or fraud), one 
        needs to consider the balance of recall and the other metrics like accuracy and precision.    
      </p>
      
      <p>The project plans to work with the available retail data and answer
        the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can item prices be accurately predicted based on current listings,
          including information like days-on-hand, markdowns, seller/product
          ratings, and recent sales (Amazon)?</li>
        <li>Which features are most significant in model predictions?</li>
        <li>Do machine learning models vary based on product type? For example, iPhone 16 vs.
          soccer jerseys, where there is some differentiation with phone model types
          but lots of similar listings, compared with soccer jerseys which are
          highly specific.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Do prices follow a normal distribution, or would a log
          transformation be prudent? Or possibly modeling based on another
          distributi on, like using Poission for recent sales counts, for
          example.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Can a machine learning model help determine which items or listings
          are competitively priced or overpriced, compared to others?</li>
        <li>On eBay, do longer titles and more pictures indicate a higher
          quality listing?</li>
        <li>Are there differences in feature significance with seller ratings on
          eBay compared with product ratings on Amazon?</li>
        <li>Will tree-based models perform better on this data given the number
          of qualitative features?</li>
        <li>How could a recommender system and / or sentiment analysis of
          reviews be incorporated into future versions of the model?</li>
        <li>(Likely for future analysis) Have the announcements for recent
          tariffs caused preemptive or necessary increases in prices for home
          goods (e.g. microwaves)? Answering this would require gaining access to
          another API service which tracks historical Amazon prices.</li>
