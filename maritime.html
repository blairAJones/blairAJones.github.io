      <!-- SECTION 1: Executive Summary (Paper page 4) -->
      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>International trade powers the global economy and significantly impacts GDP growth and individual purchasing
        power. In the modern economy, the political and social implications of international trade are vast and
        frequently
        changing.</p>

      <p>United States importers are challenged with predicting costs and delays of their goods, which affects
        inventories
        and trade cycles. In addition, importers face uncertainties as tariff announcements and impacts have shifted
        significantly in 2025. These costs materially impact procurement budgets and business decisions.</p>

      <p>At the same time, US Customs Enforcement is tasked with identifying potential tariff evasion and maintaining a
        functioning trade system while handling millions of annual international shipments.</p>

      <p>This project intends to show that machine learning and statistical analysis of international shipments could
        supplement vast domain knowledge in the field.</p>

      <p>With over five years of available shipment data for <strong>footwear</strong>, modeling based on landed cost and delay days was
        performed using different machine learning techniques. In addition, statistical analyses based on historical and
        geographical trends inform the impacts of tariff announcements in 2025.

      <!-- SECTION 2: Technical Summary (Paper page 4-5) -->
      <h2>Technical Summary</h2>

      <p>
        Data was obtained from a paid service called
        <a href="importyeti.com" target="_blank">ImportYeti.com</a>
        which uses a Freedom of
        Information Act order to obtain sea shipment bill of lading information retained by US Customs Enforcement.
        Various search fields are available, like product description, supplier name, and carrier, to name a few. Data
        is obtained in tabular form (.csv format). This was then imported into Python for cleaning, exploration,
        analysis and modeling.
      </p>

      <p>First, a regular expression extracted two words of context around footwear keywords in an attempt to clean the
        description field. For product categorization, the cleaned descriptions were embedded with
        <code>SentenceTransformer </code>(all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model) and an <em>OpenAI</em> API call to assist with embeddings
        was used to prepare a product type field, matching by category using cosine similarity. Plotting with
        <em>matplotlib</em> by type and time, along with analyzing large residuals from a simple linear regression found
        semantic mismatches (e.g., brake shoes rather than footwear), which were then removed from the analysis.</p>

      <p>Once data was cleaned, Random Forest and XGBoost were used for prediction modeling, after which Pytorch neural
        net architectures (including MLP, ResNet, and Attention models) were built to compare. Neural networks used
        learned 8-dimensional embeddings for categorical variables (routes, companies, ports, suppliers), enabling the
        models to capture feature similarity that one-hot or label encoding cannot represent.</p>

      <p>Finally, a tariff analysis on shipments was prepared using various statistical tests, including negative
        binomial counts (used over Poisson for over-dispersed data), the chi-squared test, Mann-Whitney U tests, and
        bootstrapped confidence intervals on mean difference.

      <!-- SECTION 3: Background (Paper page 5-6) -->
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <!-- PASTE: Section 3 from paper -->
      <p>International imports of footwear into the United States represent a $28Bn industry as of
        <a href="https://usatrade.census.gov" target="_blank">2024</a>.
      </p>

      <p>This project intended to use the available international shipment information for select search terms to
        determine if various statistical and machine learning techniques can tell a story about the data.</p>

      <p>A Bill of Lading is a contract of carriage and legal document which details exporter and importer information
        and responsibility. Fields from this document are parsed and stored in tabular form.</p>

      <!-- Research Questions list -->
      <p>The following questions were of most interest throughout the project:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>For shipments with CIF (Cost, Insurance, Freight) terms, can landed costs be predicted using a number of
          quantitative and qualitative features, including supplier name, shipment volume, product type etc.?</li>
        <li>Can delays be predicted using temporal features and carrier information?</li>
        <li>Due to recent tariff actions, is there a way to identify changes in shipment activity by weight / volume and
          departure location?</li>
        <li>Are there certain techniques that model the data better than others, and which features of the data are the
          most important in those models?</li>
      </ol>

      <!-- Tariff Timeline Table -->
      <h3>U.S. Tariff Actions on Chinese Imports</h3>
      <p>Some important dates regarding tariff announcements in 2025 are as follows. Note that due to the high
        concentration of footwear imports from China, this specific 
        <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/us-china-tariff-rates-2025/" target="_blank">timeline</a>
        is significant. </p>
