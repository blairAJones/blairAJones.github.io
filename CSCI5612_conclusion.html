      <h1 class="mb-4">Conclusion</h1>

      <p>This project provided insight into how well various machine learning
        models can classify and predict prices of certain products based on a
        variety of features from from the listings on online retail sites like
        eBay and Amazon. The original data sets were iPhone and Soccer Jerseys
        from eBay and Microwaves and Lego from Amazon. The Amazon data had fewer
        data points, especially after data cleaning and pre-processing. In
        general, performance was not as strong on this data, and ultimately
        mostly the eBay data sets were the point of focus. The
        <a href="CSCI5612.html">Amazon API</a>
        was limited for the free tier and so more data was not readily available
        at this time. In future versions of this project, additional data
        sources can be considered.</p>
      <p>The unsupervised learning portion of the project led to some insights
        on feature consolidation, but ultimately showed that it is a challenge
        to find natural clustering of this data. Principal component analysis
        attempted to combine features in meaningful ways, like high-quality
        listing and high-quality seller. However, due to the limited continuous
        numerical features, dimension reduction was not needed as much as would
        be using other data sets.  It was noted that the Naive Bayes accuracy using 
        PCA features did perform better, likely because the newly uncorrelated features 
        helped with that method.  K-Means and Hierarchical clustering also
        requires only continuous numerical features, and thus it was difficult
        in finding natural clustering of the data. Other methods such as K-Modes
        and K-Prototypes methods, which allow for categorical features, will be
        explored in future analysis.</p>
      <p>The supervised learning models included k-nearest neighbors and naive
        Bayes, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.
        Model performance was mixed depending on model type.</p>

      </p>  

        For the most part,
        classification models were built to determine price buckets or tiers.
        Naive Bayes suffered likely due to the feature independence assumption.
        Support vector machines only handle two-class separation, so a simple
        <code>is_high_price</code> classifier, based on median, was created from the price
        field. While the classes are balanced in this case, there could be an
        issue if many data points are very close to the median and thus a strong
        boundary is not evident. SVMs have flexibility to transform the
        data into higher dimensional spaces for separation, but are limited in
        that only continuous numerical features are able to be used. Decision
        trees and neural networks are more flexible in terms of feature usage;
        although categorical features require pre-processing into a
        one-hot-encoding. Because these models aren’t based on data vector distance measures,
        cateogorical and binary features are still an option for training. In addition, decision trees 
        and neural nets can
        be used for multi-class classification. Because of the high number of
        categorical and binary features for this data, these two model types are better fits
        for the data. Additional analysis could be done on random forest
        regression and additional ensemble methods, like XGBoost as well 
        as additional tuning of NNs.</p>
      <p>The data cleaning and processing continued throughout the whole
        project. A number of fields were created based on information found in
        the title field. Fields were even introduced in the middle of the
        project; for example, after analyzing mis-classes on the iPhone data
        set, the writer noted a <em>Model Type</em> (Plus, Pro Max, etc.) in
        most listings that likely have an influence on the price and thus would
        be beneficial to have as a feature. Some of the created features weren’t
        available for all listings; for example, <em>year</em> in the soccer
        jerseys listings, which was extracted for many but some were blank.
        Models like random forests can handle missing values, but most other
        models cannot. A decision then needs to be made to remove the missing
        data points and still use that feature, or to exclude that field as a
        feature. In future versions of the project, performance could be
        compared on models that include features with fewer data points versus
        models that exclude those particular features and have a higher number of 
        observations.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, as it was proposed in the <a href="CSCI5612.html">Introduction</a>, decision
        trees, particular random forests with tuned hyperparameters, performed
        well and gave the best trade-off between performance and
        interpretability. Decision trees can be visualized with understandable
        cut-offs for decisions and feature importance can be easily extracted
        from the final models. As mentioned above, these models can handle
        missing values as well as categorical and binary features, of which
        there are many for this data. Neural networks provided similar
        flexibility with feature selection; however, remain difficult to
        interpret and extract how the individual features influenced the model.
        Future versions of this project will dive deeper into decision tree and
        ensemble models (like boosting) as well as additional neural network
        refinement.</p>



      <p>The following questions were posed at the beginning of the project, now along with answers based on the
        results.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
            Can item prices be accurately predicted based on current listings, including information like days-on-hand,
            markdowns, seller/product ratings, and recent sales (Amazon)?
          </strong>
          <p style="margin-left: 1.2em; color: #555;">
            Yes, a neural network regression (compared with baseline multiple linear regression) was able to predict
            prices of iPhones and soccer jerseys well below the standard deviation of the price data, meaning the models
            have some predictive power. The tuned random forest classification models were able to predict price tiers
            with minimal low/high mis-classes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
            Which features are most significant in model predictions?
          </strong>
          <p style="margin-left: 1.2em; color: #555;">
            This depends on the data set. For iPhones, model number, and by a smaller measure, the model type, were
            important features, along with days listed. For soccer jerseys, the seller feedback score was the top
            feature, with days listed, year and title length all noted as well. For Microwaves, the cubic feet (product
            size) was by far the top feature. And with Lego, the number of ratings and discount amount were noted as the
            top features.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
            Do machine learning models vary based on product type? For example, iPhone 16 vs. soccer jerseys, where
            there is some differentiation with phone model types but lots of similar listings, compared with soccer
            jerseys which are highly specific.
          </strong>
          <p style="margin-left: 1.2em; color: #555;">
            Random Forests and Neural Nets performed well for both the iPhone and Soccer data. It should be noted that
            the iPhone NN regression model showed slight improvement over the baseline MLR model; while the Soccer NN
            regression model showed a more significant improvement. This could indicate that there are inherent differences in the data itself (some
            amount of linearity vs. flexibility).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
            Do prices follow a normal distribution, or would a log transformation be prudent? Or possibly modeling based
            on another distribution, like using Poisson for recent sales counts, for example.
          </strong>
          <p style="margin-left: 1.2em; color: #555;">
            Prices generally do not follow a normal distribution. Log transformation of prices did not improve the
            performance of the regression models used; however, the majority of models tested in this project were
            classification and thus not relevant. More analysis is needed if additional regression-based models are
            trained.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
            Can a machine learning model help determine which items or listings are competitively priced or overpriced,
            compared to others?
          </strong>
          <p style="margin-left: 1.2em; color: #555;">
            On the models that allow multi-class classification, the writer was able to split the data into low, medium
            and high pricing tiers. Potentially overpriced items were considered those that were predicted <em>low</em>
            but had a <em>high</em> true value, with potentially underpriced items the opposite. Additional analysis
            should be completed on those specific items to see if additional information can be extracted from the
            listing that may prove to be a meaningful feature ("retro" or "rare" in title, for example.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
            On eBay, do longer titles and more pictures indicate a higher quality listing?
          </strong>
          <p style="margin-left: 1.2em; color: #555;">
            In PCA analysis, longer titles and additional images had the most influence on PC1, which indicates there is
            a relationship between these two variables. <em>High-quality listing</em> is challenging to measure, but
            there appears to be some influence of these features with each other and on modeling price (based on RF
            feature importance).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
            Are there differences in feature significance with seller ratings on eBay compared with product ratings on
            Amazon?
          </strong>
          <p style="margin-left: 1.2em; color: #555;">
            Seller ratings and product ratings both appeared in the top 10 feature imporatances for the eBay and Amazon
            products, respectively. They appear to be important in both cases.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
            Will tree-based models perform better on this data given the number of qualitative features?
          </strong>
          <p style="margin-left: 1.2em; color: #555;">
            Based on overall accuracy metrics, random forest models performed well on this data. The ability to include
            categorical and binary features, along with the ability to train on some that have missing values, was
            important for this data, given the low number of truly continuous numerical features.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
            How could a recommender system and / or sentiment analysis of reviews be incorporated into future versions
            of the model?
          </strong>
          <p style="margin-left: 1.2em; color: #555;">
            This is to be determined. It would be interesting to see if sentiment analysis was in-line with the
            numerical ratings on the Amazon data.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
            (Likely for future analysis) Have the announcements for recent tariffs caused preemptive or necessary
            increases in prices for home goods (e.g. microwaves)? Answering this would require gaining access to another
            API service which tracks historical Amazon prices.
          </strong>
          <p style="margin-left: 1.2em; color: #555;">
            This is to be determined. All data used in this analysis was static, based on the current prices as of the
            run date (July 10, 2025).
