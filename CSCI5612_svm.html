      <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
      <p>Support vector machines are supervised learning models that focus on
        classification using a hyperplane (p-1 dimensional, with p being the number
        of data features). The model assumes the best choice of hyperplane is
        the one that has the largest margin (separation) between the classes.
        Because often the data is not linearly separable, SVM offers the ability
        to convert the data into higher dimensions (imagine points in 2D moving
        upward into the third dimension). This is computationally feasible given
        the kernel trick, which finds the dot products of the data points as if it
        was already in the higher dimensional space, and then finding the
        optimal hyperplane from there.</p>
      <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/4/svm_ex.png" width="60%" alt="SVM Example - Polynomial Degree 2 kernel" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">SVM Example - Polynomial Degree 2
          kernel</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The above is a synthetic example of data that is not linearly
        separable in 2D, but is when transformed using a degree 2 polynomial. The
        following are the Kernel function and the feature mapping (new
        coordinates) of x into 3D.</p>
      <p><span class="math inline">\(K(x, y) = (x \cdot y)^2 = (x_1y_1 +
          x_2y_2)^2 = x_1^2y_1^2 + 2x_1x_2y_1y_2 + x_2^2y_2^2\)</span></p>
      <p><span class="math inline">\(\phi(x) = (x_1^2, \sqrt{2}x_1x_2,
          x_2^2)\)</span></p>
      <p>We can see that the transformation allows for a hyperplane
        separation.</p>
      <p>SVM models can be tuned using different hyperparameters. These
        include cost, C, which manages the allowance for misclassifications,
        where a higher C more harshly penalizes mis-classes but can lead to
        overfitting of the training data. Gamma (poly and rbf) measures the
        influence of training points depending on distance (high gamma means
        only close points have influence). And the coefficient (poly) is the
        bias term in the kernel function. Polynomial kernels also are dictated
        by degree (2, 3, 4) which can affect the curviness of the boundary.</p>

      <p>Since support vector machines compute dot products of feature
        vectors, only scaled numerical features were used in training these
        models.</p>

      <p>For all datasets, a train/test split was created (80/20%). All models
        were trained on the training set, and then a confusion matrix with
        metrics were evaluated on the test. This is a critical piece of model
        building and comparison, to not overfit the data and see performance on
        unseen data.</p>

      <p>All models were tuned using a grid search of hyperparameters. The
        grid search uses cross-validation (set at cv = 10) and averages the
        accuracy results for each fold to determine the best hyperparameters on
        the training data. These are then used on the test set. Note that the
        grid search allows for different metrics to be considered, such as
        kernel (linear, poly, rbf), cost (0.1, 1, 10), gamma (0.1, 1 poly, rbf
        only), coef (0, 1 poly only), and degree (2, 3, 4 poly only).</p>

      <p>The scoring parameter can also be adjusted depending on which metric
        to be emphasized, for example, accuracy, F1, or recall, among
        others.</p>
      <h4 id="iphone">iPhone</h4>
      <p>The iPhone data was modeled using SVM to classify <em>High

</div>
      <p>Cross-validation found the best model, based on accuracy scoring, was
        a linear model with a relatively high cost of 10. This means the data is
        linearly separable and there is a high penalization for mis-classed
        points. Note that the data is in 7D (seven numerical features) so
        visualizing the hyperplane is a challenge.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/4/cm_svm_iphone.png" width="40%"/></p>
      <p>The model performed fairly well against the test set, with 76%
        accuracy.</p>
      <p>One of the challenges with SVM is interpretation, especially when the
        kernel trick is used to transform the data into higher dimensions. All
        of the datasets have more than two features, so visualizing is also
        difficult. An attempt to visualize the decision boundaries on PCA
        reduced data is presented; however, still shows the challenges with this
        exercise.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/4/svm_boundary_iphone.png" width="40%"/></p>
      <p>There appears to be quite a few mis-classes from the above; however,
        this is likely due to the reduction of the data down to the first 2
        principal components, and information is getting lost.</p>
      <p>Additional analysis on the model was performed related to ROC-AUC and
        Precision-Recall and Calibration, using the CalibratedClassifierCV()
        function. ROC-AUC shows how the model ranks true positives above false
        positives and average precision represents the weighted mean of
        precisions and different recall levels.  Precision is the model's ability to correctly identify 
        <em>only</em> the relevant instances and recall is the model's ability to <em>find</em> all of the relevant instances.
        ROC-AUC and average precision
        uses probabilities from the model, with a 0.5 cut-off. The calibration
        allows the user to identify if a different threshold is better. Then,
        the y predictions can be updated to the new threshold (e.g. 0.62 instead
        of 0.5 to determine 0/1).</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/4/calibration_roc_pr_iphone.png" width="100%"/></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/4/cm_svm_iphone2.png" width="40%"/></p>
      <p>Updating the y-predictions based on a new threshold showed that
        accuracy and F1 score improved while recall came down.</p>
      <h5 id="priority-listing-classification">Priority Listing
        Classification</h5>
      <p>In addition to using median price as the classification metric, the
        column <em>Priority Listing</em> (True/False) was considered as a
        classification response.  It should be noted that the classes are imbalanced for the training
        data (compared with High Price classification which is based on the
        median value):</p>
      <p>Training and testing sets:</p> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(array([False, True]), array([229, 79]))</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(array([False, True]), array([61, 17]))</p>
      <p>So additional considerations are needed. In the SVC function,
        <code>class_weights="balanced”</code> should be passed through. During the grid
        search, instead of using “accuracy” as the scoring measure, one may
        consider F1 or Recall, which may handle better when the minority class
        is positive.</p>
      <p>For the iPhone data, the grid search cross-validation found:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best CV Recall: 0.7732142857142856</p> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best CV Parameters: {‘C’: 10,
        ‘coef0’: 0, ‘degree’: 4, ‘gamma’: ‘scale’, ‘kernel’: ‘poly’}</p>
      <p>For the new response variable, a different model was chosen from CV,
        a degree 4 polynomial. The boundaries are more complex and curved than
        the data when the response was <em>high price</em>.</p>
      <p>Similar to above, a calibration was performed based on probability
        thresholds, with the following noted:</p>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">
        <p><img src="images/4/cm_svm_iphone3.png" alt="Image 1" width="500">
          <img src="images/4/cm_svm_iphone4.png" alt="Image 2" width="500">
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>Note that the raw SVM using recall as the scoring method suffered in
        accuracy as more false positives were noted. After calibrating, recall
        came down but accuracy improved significantly.  Hyperparameters are the same
        because the model is not re-fit; rather, calibration is done post-hoc and attempts to 
        adjust decision thresholds based on probabilities.</p>
      <h4 id="soccer">Soccer</h4>
      <p><em>High price</em> classification was performed on the soccer data
        set using SVM with grid search. The following were noted:</p>

      <p>Cross-validation found the best model based on accuracy was a degree

      <p>The soccer data initial SVM model follows the ideal calibration line
        better than the iPhone data. Running a CalibratedClassifierSV() model

        from the original data. The same numerical features were used, except
        <em>price</em> is now added as a feature.
      </p>
      <p>The classes are unbalanced in favor of the positive class
        (training/test sets, respectively):</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(array([False, True]), array([ 31, 121]))</p> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(array([False, True]), array([ 9, 29]))</p>
      <p>Because of this, the <code>class_weights</code> parameter was used in the
        model and different scoring options in the grid search were used,
        including accuracy, balanced accuracy, and F1.</p>

      <p>None of the models captured the true negatives (minority class)
        particularly well, but balanced accuracy scoring was better than the
        others. The hyperparameters found in CV were different based on scoring
        method. Ultimately, classifying a listing based on <em>top theme</em>
        did not prove to work especially well with these models.</p>

      <p>Support vector machines offer flexibility with hyperparameter tuning
        depending on the data sets, and even within the same data sets,
        differences were found when considering alternative response variables.
        All models performed relatively well across the data.</p>
      <p>The grid search scoring (e.g. F1, recall, accuracy, etc.) option is a
        way to emphasize certain metrics depending on what the model is
        classifying. For example, in a model that requires a certain level of
        recall (like fraud cases), the “recall” scoring method should be used
        when searching for the best hyperparameters to be used in the model.
        Then, the calibration process after the model is built can be used in
        further analysis of decision levels (probability thresholds). It should
        be noted that only focusing on one metric can impact the overall
        performance of the model.</p>
      <p>SVM are not able to capture categorical features (or binary features
        well, because the distance is not meaningful), so there is a limit with
        this particular data, that other models like Random Forests could
        overcome. Nevertheless, the flexibility of SVM offers a solution to
        modeling product listings across online retail sites.</p>
